    <h4>Introduction:</h4>
    <p2>
        I am a student at Furman University, graduating class of 
        '24. I major in Computer Science and Japanese Studies, with a minor in 
        Linguistics. During my college career, I have participated in Historical 
        Linguistics research, investigating the linguistic origins of the Japanese 
        and Korean languages. I have presented this research at The Southeast 
        Conference of the Association for Asian Studies (SEC/AAS 2024), and intend 
        to publish my findings in the coming year.
